Notes 7 May

1. Keep Aguiar Hurst pictures, add version with fixed effects

2. Consumption around retirement:
	- Go to tertiles
	- Do all years and post 2005
	- Retirement:
		Head - last job ended due to quitting, resigned, retired, n/a
		50 and 80, never return to work
	- TODO - Is there some way of identidying the partial retirees. Perhaps if they report both retired and working in emp_status_head, emp_status_head_2, or emp_status_head_3
	- Four versions:
		- Spouse never works
		- Spouse always works
		- Spouse has same* retirement transition *for +/- one wave
		- Spouse has a different retirement transition
	- Consider 3 year moving average

	- Some comprehensive categorization

1		- Food at home
		- Food stamps


2		- Food away


3		- Utilities
		- Home insurance
		- Imputed Rent
		
4		- Health Insurance
		- Health Services
		- *Repairs


5		- Education
		- Childcare

6		- Gasoline
		- Transportation


7		- *Vacations/Trips
		- *Recreation


8		- *Clothing




Subsequent:
	- Do these with HH FE, time Deatoned
	- Changes at HH level, percentiles.
	-CAMS RAND data


Question for Martin:
	- Why we need instrument in AIDS for x? Just measurement error?
	- Problems with estimating AIDS outside the model


Durables
		- Furnishing



			
Next steps as of 25 May:
-expenditure graphs with common scale  (remove the rescale option)
-label for axes
-caption in the graph with number of HHs (put it in a note) use note()

- Section 8 of the latex doc
	-cleaning figures
	-add standard errors
	-unsmoothed version
- Section 9
	-8 expenditure categories and 5 spouse categories
	-smoothed version
	-\subsection{Spouse Never Works}


-move to regsave for these plots... so later we can add controls
-3 year MA or 5 year MA (tssmooth)
-to compute SEs for MA... regress expenditure on time period. test whether it's equal to zero, loop over time periods
test (coef L.coef L2.coef)/3
produces se

-todo: why does the number of obs in each tertile change?

Just in case

Tuesday, May 29
1. Find the Smoothed Standard for both sections of graphs in section 8 and 9.  
	-  Fixed effect to the regression. 
	- Do not control for anything (may be later, control for kids) 

3. Just drop the Early Retirees
4. Do all the dropping consistently. Early.
5. Take the people who retire early. check their education. If college graduate= top, 	high school drop out = botton. 
	Between put in the middle. 
6. Go with heads social security income
7. Take the maximum (?)

Wednesday, May 30, 2018

1. Spouse retired before the head of household and after the head of the household

2. Drop the unsmoothed
3. put the def 5 in the first
4. one more definition
5. controlling for time?? 
6. age period  - multicollinearity problem. 
	cohort effects/ time effects/ 
	patrick has the code for this. We can use it. 
7. Do the coefficients add up? For the categories to total imputed categories? 
	Check this. 
8. Add clothing and recreation?

9. Demand model for 0 working, one working, 2 working
10. Life cycle modeling: 
Every household. One in four type. 
 - High and low men and women income. 
 - We keep five groups. 
 Every household has two different entries. 
 	- for household A:
 	 - enter in the dataset twice, consumption data same, labor supply data will be different.

 - Who are the head of household? Are they all male or female?
 - What if they are not couple? 
 		- which group of definition are they included in? 
 - Singles add a new definition on the spouse group

 - Income for different definition of spouse retirement
 - In page 8, relabel work related expenditure graph. 

Update at the end of: 
Friday June 01, 2018

1. Spouse retired before the head of household and after the head of the household
	DONE. Added in the defination.
 	Def-6 - Spouse retires after the head
 	Def 7 - Spouse retires before the head
 	Def 8 - Retirement of the head when the head is single

2. Drop the unsmoothed from section 8
	DONE

3. put the def 5 in the first
 	DONE. Now the category starts with 1 - Ignoring the Spouse.

4. Age Period  - multicollinearity problem. 
	DONE. Added this in both section 9 and 10. Section 9 is mean expenditure of total non durables. 
	Section 10 is - mean expenditure on each categorical variable 

7. Do the coefficients add up? For the categories to total imputed categories? 
	Added this in the section 8. We have checked the sum for defination of spouse retirement for the first three category only. 

8. Add clothing and recreation?
	Added clothing and recreation in section 10. 

QUESTIONS to THINK:
1. Retirement defination should we change. 
		When spouse retires after the head, we have very small number of observations. (4, 6, 4)


Meeting June 01, 2018, Friday
- Add Error bands (-15, 15) in retirement x axis
   Done
2. Subtract health expenditure from total non-durables
   Done
3. Add in controls for number for kids
   Added. dummy for one, dummy for two, dummy for three or more
 

 Monday, June 04
 1. Side by side for expenditure with health and non health in total non-durables
 For each spouse definition, 3 graphs:
   a.  Total spending including health and education
   b.  side by side: one subtracting health  and one subtracting both health and   		education

 Drawing the regression table
 	1. Child
 	2. Age
 	3. put retirement dummy
 	One version with age/ and one without age

Different columns
