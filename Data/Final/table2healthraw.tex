\footnotesize *These values are not medians but percentiles, as indicated in the parentheses. \linebreak --- \linebreak This table references Table 2 of Hurd and Rohwedder's paper: Heterogeneity in spending change at retirement. \linebreak --- \linebreak This spending category is defined by health insurance, drugs, health services, and medical supplies in CAMS. \linebreak --- \linebreak Mean percent change is not reported because observation error on spending can produce large outliers when spending is put in ratio form. \linebreak --- \linebreak N = 919.
