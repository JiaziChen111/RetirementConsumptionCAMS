\multicolumn{4}{l}{\footnotesize \shortstack[l]{\\ The spending categories are defined in accordance with page 9 (Table 1: Variable \\ Names Across Waves) of the RAND\_CAMS\_2015V2 Data Documentation file.  \\ --- \\ The wave consistent measures are CAMS generated and exclude house services, yard \\ services, personal care, and household furnishings (which effect total and nondurables). \\ --- \\ The housing category is significantly larger for CAMS Generated and Wave Consistent \\ because RAND eliminates principal from mortgage spending so that only mortgage \\ interest and charges remain. \\ --- \\ The other differences can be explained by the lack of imputation from the CAMS \\ generated values. These values have also been winsorized. \\ --- \\ The number of observations is 30124.}}\\
