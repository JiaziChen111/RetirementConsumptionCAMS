\section{Mean and median comparisons}
Three types of spending categories (e.g. total, nondurables durables, transportation, housing) are created to compare mean and median values: (1) CAMS generated by adding up individual wave spending categories (2) RAND CAMS variables that are aggregated by RAND (3) wave consistent CAMS generated by adding up spending categories from individual waves while excluding house services, yard services, personal care, and household furnishings (which effect total and nondurables).

\section{Real spending with and without retirement transition} 
These tables seek to reproduce table 1 from Hurd and Rohwedder's paper on Heterogeneity in spending change at retirement. Table 1 shows the means and medians of total real spending before and after retirement and the median of the change in spending calculated over households where retirement occurred between CAMS waves.

\section{Real spending with retirement transition (wealth tertiles)} 
These tables seek to reproduce table 2 from Hurd and Rohwedder's paper on Heterogeneity in spending change at retirement. Table 2 shows spending levels, both mean and median, by wealth quartile before and after retirement, percent changes in them, and the median of the change at the household level. 
\newline
\newline
These tables describe spending in wealth tertiles. The spending categories are: nondurables, durables, totals; food at home, food away from home, transportation, health, education (no spending variable in CAMS or HRS), housing, recreation, and clothing.

\section{Real spending with retirement transition (social security income tertiles)} 
These tables seek to reproduce table 2 from Hurd and Rohwedder's paper on Heterogeneity in spending change at retirement. Table 2 shows spending levels, both mean and median, by wealth quartile before and after retirement, percent changes in them, and the median of the change at the household level. 
\newline
\newline
These tables describe spending in social security income tertiles. The spending categories are: nondurables, durables, totals; food at home, food away from home, transportation, health, education (no spending variable in CAMS or HRS), housing, recreation, and clothing.
\newline
An individualâ€™s social security income is estimated as a person's highest social security across all waves in order to protect from early claiming at a discount and 0 values. In order to impute missing values, an individual was assigned into tertiles based on the head's years of education (cutoffs at 0-11; 12-15; 16-).

\section{Real household income with retirement transition} 
These tables seek to reproduce table 3 from Hurd and Rohwedder's paper on Heterogeneity in spending change at retirement.  Table 3 shows household income before and after retirement as measured in the HRS core data. There are two tables below: one for wealth tertiles and another for social security income tertiles.

\section{Median percent change by financial planning horizon (wealth tertiles)} 
These tables seek to reproduce table 6 from Hurd and Rohwedder's paper on Heterogeneity in spending change at retirement. Table 6 shows median percent change before and after retirement in real spending categories by wealth tertiles and financial planning horizon.
\newline
The spending categories are: nondurables, durables, totals; food at home, food away from home, transportation, health, education (no spending variable in CAMS or HRS), housing, recreation, and clothing.
