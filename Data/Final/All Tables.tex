\section{Mean and median comparisons}
Three types of spending categories (e.g. total, nondurables durables, transportation, housing) are created to compare mean and median values: (1) CAMS generated by adding up individual wave spending categories (2) RAND CAMS variables that are aggregated by RAND (3) wave consistent CAMS generated by adding up spending categories from individual waves while excluding house services, yard services, personal care, and household furnishings (which effect total and nondurables).

\section{Average and median real spending before and after retirement/without retirement transition (Table 1 of Hurd and Rohwedder)} 
These tables seek to reproduce table 1 from Hurd and Rohwedder's paper on Heterogeneity in spending change at retirement. Table 1 shows the means and medians of total real spending before and after retirement and the median of the change in spending calculated over households where retirement occurred between CAMS waves.

\section{Real spending before and after retirement with wealth tertiles (Table 2 of Hurd and Rohwedder)} 
These tables seek to reproduce table 2 from Hurd and Rohwedder's paper on Heterogeneity in spending change at retirement. Table 2 shows spending levels, both mean and median, by wealth quartile before and after retirement, percent changes in them, and the median of the change at the household level. 
\newline
These tables describe spending in wealth tertiles. The spending categories are: nondurables, durables, totals; food at home, food away from home, transportation, health, education (no spending variable in CAMS or HRS), housing, recreation, and clothing.

\section{Real spending before and after retirement with social security income tertiles (Table 2 of Hurd and Rohwedder)} 
These tables seek to reproduce table 2 from Hurd and Rohwedder's paper on Heterogeneity in spending change at retirement. Table 2 shows spending levels, both mean and median, by wealth quartile before and after retirement, percent changes in them, and the median of the change at the household level. 
\newline
These tables describe spending in social security income tertiles. The spending categories are: nondurables, durables, totals; food at home, food away from home, transportation, health, education (no spending variable in CAMS or HRS), housing, recreation, and clothing.
\newline
An individualâ€™s social security income is estimated as a person's highest social security across all waves in order to protect from early claiming at a discount and 0 values. In order to impute missing values, an individual was assigned into tertiles based on the head's years of education (cutoffs at 0-11; 12-15; 16-).
